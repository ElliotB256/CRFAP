%This code implements the shooting method for solving 1D boundary value problem (abbrev. BVP ODE). 
%It uses the Runge-Kutta method of 4th order for solving ODE and the interval bisection method for finding the alpha parameter. 
%
%The meaning of input and output parameters: 
%x - grid of points where the solution have been found
%y - 2D array, values of function (solution) are in first row, values of
%    1st derivative are in second row
%fun - the function handle, fun contains system of solved differential
%      equations, e.g. let y'' + y = sqrt(x+1) be the solved differential
%      equation, then fun has the shape:
%      function out = fce(x,y)
%         out(1) = y(2);
%         out(2) = sqrt(x+1)-y(1);
%h - the step of the Runge-Kutta method (the step of the grid)            
%zero - the interval bisection method accuracy, it is recommended to set 1e-6 
%a,b - outer points of the interval
%con - values of boundary conditions (2D vector)
%type - to specify type of the boundary condition in the particular point,
%       it is the string consists of 2 char ('f' for function, 'd' for
%       derivative), e.g 'fd' is meant that in a point the condition is
%       related to function and in the b point to derivative
%init - 2D vector of initial alpha parameters, it is not required, the implicit
%       value is [-10 10]
%
%The ploting of the solution:
%The solution (both function and 1st derivative) of BVP ODE is shown graphicaly after enumeration.
%
%The example of using:
%[x y] = shooting_method(fun,0.001,1e-6,0,1,[1 3],'fd')  
%It is meant that will be solved the BVP ODE described in the function fun,
%on the interval (0,1) with boundary conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(1) = 3
