%% Transition Temperatures
% Determine transition temperatures and a variety of useful quantities for
% the overlap parameters calculated in GravitationalSagOverlap.
%
% Prerequisite: Must run GravitationalSagSeparation to find amplitude of
% RF1 for 85/87 overlap.

%% Trap frequencies
% Begin by re-evaluating the axial trap frequencies for both 85 and 87.



%% Threshold N0 for 85 collapse
% Determine the number of condensed 85 atoms for given trap frequency
% that will cause collapse of the condensate.

%% 85 Collapse Temperature
% N0 = N * ( 1 - (T/T_c).^3).
% 
% Plot for a number of different N
