# CalcAP: Calculator for Rf-dressed Adiabatic Potentials #

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains a number of functions and classes that can be used to calculate the eigenenergies of atoms in rf-dressed potentials.
* Supports F=1 and F=2, also Rb87 and Rb85. It should be straightforward to add more states/species as you require them!
* Supports spatially uniform rf fields of arbitrary polarisation (eg circular, linear)
* Supports multi-frequency fields.

Please feel free to ask me for help if you would like any!

### What is this repository NOT for? ###

* This repository is NOT for graph-generating scripts, specific investigations, parameter sweeps etc. These should be stored in a separate repo. You can add this folder to the Matlab path to use functions/classes within it. Keep this repository just for the package, not it's use.
