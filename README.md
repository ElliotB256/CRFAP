# Dressing RF and TAAP Calculation Packages #

### What is this repository for? ###

* A number of useful Matlab functions for evaluating adiabatic potentials.
* Supports F=1 and F=1.
* Currently supports 3d evaluation of circular polarized rf and multiple rf components (MRF).
* In future it will support arbitrary combinations of polarization of the rf components.

### What is this repository NOT for? ###

* It is NOT for the actual graph-generating scripts or specific investigations. Use the [Scripts Repo](https://bitbucket.org/footgroup/apscripts) for this.
* Scripts will be migrated from this directory over time.
